My Node.js CLI Project
This is a simple automation script I made using Node.js. The main purpose of this code is to fetch data from an API and save it locally in a file so we can read it later without internet.

I used the File System (fs) module to handle the files and fetch to get the data from the placeholder website.

How it works
Basically, the script connects to jsonplaceholder and gets Users and Posts. Then it saves everything into a file called cache.json. You can use commands to read this data.

Requirements to run
You need to have Node.js installed on your computer.

No external libraries are needed, just standard modules.

How to use the commands
You have to run this file using the terminal or command prompt. Here is the list of commands you can use.

Important: You must run the refresh command first otherwise it will say "No data available".

1. Download the data
This fetches the data from the internet and updates the cache file.

Bash

node server.js refresh
2. See a list of posts
This will show the posts ID and Title. You can put a limit number at the end.

Bash

node server.js list-posts 10
3. Find a specific Post
If you want to see the details of one post, use the ID.

Bash

node server.js post 5
4. Find a specific User
To see the details of a user inside the system.

Bash

node server.js user 2
5. Filter posts by a User
If you want to see all posts written by a specific user ID.

Bash

node server.js filter-posts 10
